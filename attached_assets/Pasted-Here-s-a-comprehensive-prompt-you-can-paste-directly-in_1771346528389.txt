Here's a comprehensive prompt you can paste directly into Replit Agent:

---

**"I want to add a Strategic Swimlane Roadmap feature to my existing project management application. Below is the full specification.**

**FEATURE NAME: Strategic Thought Screen — Multi-Template Portfolio Roadmap**

---

**OVERVIEW**
Build a standalone module/page called `StrategicRoadmap` that can be embedded into the existing app. It allows CEOs, CTOs, and Principal PMs to create multiple roadmap templates, each with custom streams/services, projects, and action points — visualized as a Gantt-style swimlane chart.

---

**ARCHITECTURE: 3 layers**

**Layer 1 — Template Gallery (index/home view)**
- Grid of cards, one per saved template
- Each card shows: template name, description, color bar, stream tags, project count
- Actions per card: Open, Duplicate, Delete
- A "New Template" card (dashed border) opens a creation modal
- On open → navigate to Layer 2

**Layer 2 — New Template Modal**
- Fields: Template Name (required), Description, Streams/Services list (dynamic add/remove, minimum 1)
- On confirm → create template and navigate to Layer 3

**Layer 3 — Roadmap Editor (split-panel view)**
- Left panel (fixed width ~320px, scrollable): form + stream manager + project list accordion
- Right panel (flex, scrollable horizontally): Gantt swimlane chart

---

**DATA SCHEMA**

```
Template {
  id: number | string
  name: string
  description: string
  streams: string[]         // ordered list of stream/service names
  projects: Project[]
}

Project {
  id: number | string
  name: string
  startDate: string         // format: 'YYYY-MM'
  endDate: string           // format: 'YYYY-MM'
  stream: string            // must match a value in Template.streams
  actionPoints: string[]    // bullet list of tasks
}
```

---

**LEFT PANEL — behaviour**

**Stream Manager (collapsible section)**
- List all streams with color dot indicator
- Inline "Add New" input (confirm on Enter or button click)
- Delete stream on hover (with confirmation if it has projects)
- Auto-assign colors from a 15-color palette by index

**Project Form — dual mode**
- ADD mode (default): empty fields, "Add Project" button (blue)
- EDIT mode (when a project is selected): fields pre-populated, "Update Project" button (green) + "Cancel" button
- Fields: Project Name, Start Date (month picker), End Date (month picker), Stream (dropdown), Action Points (dynamic list, add/remove rows)
- Blue info banner visible in EDIT mode with cancel link

**Projects Accordion**
- Header shows "Projects (n)" with chevron toggle
- Each item: project name, date range, stream label (colored), action point count
- Click item → enters EDIT mode (Mirror Effect)
- Delete button (X) per item with stopPropagation

---

**RIGHT PANEL — Gantt chart**

**Timeline header**
- Months auto-calculated from min(startDate) to max(endDate) across all projects
- Each column = 1 month, labeled "MMM YY"

**Swimlanes**
- One horizontal swimlane per stream (skip if no projects in that stream)
- Stream label on the left (colored, bold)

**Stacking logic (within each swimlane)**
- Sort projects by startDate
- Use a lane-finding algorithm: place each project in the first available vertical lane where no overlap exists
- Projects in different streams do NOT affect each other's lane index

**Project bars**
- Position and width calculated as % of total timeline
- Color = stream color
- Text truncated with ellipsis if bar is too short

**Interactions**
1. HOVER → show tooltip (do NOT remove on click):
   - Full project name (bold)
   - Date range
   - Divider line
   - Action points as bullet list
   - Stream-colored CheckCircle icon
2. CLICK → Mirror Effect:
   - Sets selectedProject state
   - Left panel populates with that project's data (EDIT mode)
   - Selected bar gets: ring border, scale(1.02), full opacity
   - Other bars slightly dimmed (opacity 0.9)

---

**STATE MANAGEMENT**
- `templates: Template[]` — top-level, persisted (localStorage or your existing DB/state layer)
- `activeTemplateId: number | null` — which template is open
- Per-editor: `selectedProject`, `hoveredProject`, `formData`, `isProjectsExpanded`, `showStreamInput`
- On every project/stream mutation → call save/update handler to persist

---

**NAVIGATION FLOW**
```
Gallery → [click Open]    → Roadmap Editor
Gallery → [click + New]   → Modal → Roadmap Editor
Editor  → [click ← Back] → Gallery
```

---

**VISUAL / STYLE REQUIREMENTS**
- Match existing app's design system (fonts, border radius, button styles)
- Color palette for streams (15 colors, cycle by index):
  `['#10b981','#3b82f6','#8b5cf6','#f59e0b','#ec4899','#06b6d4','#ef4444','#84cc16','#f97316','#a855f7','#14b8a6','#f43f5e','#22c55e','#eab308','#6366f1']`
- Gantt bars: rounded, white text, shadow-sm, hover shadow-lg
- Tooltip: white bg, border, rounded-lg, shadow-xl, 256px wide, z-index 50
- Selected bar: ring-4, scale(1.02)
- Stream labels: bold, left-aligned, 160px fixed column

---

**SEED DATA (optional, for testing)**
Include 3 default templates:
1. **Product Roadmap** — streams: Growth, Retention, Platform, Infrastructure, Experience — 10 sample projects spanning 2025–2026
2. **Digital Marketing Plan** — streams: SEO, Paid Ads, Social Media, Email Marketing, Content — 8 sample projects spanning 2025–2026
3. **Sales & CRM** — streams: Lead Generation, Outreach, Pipeline, Closing, Account Management — 7 sample projects spanning 2025

---

**INTEGRATION NOTES FOR REPLIT**
- Build as a self-contained React component/module exportable as `<StrategicRoadmap />`
- Accept optional props: `initialTemplates`, `onSave(templates)` for integration with existing data layer
- No external charting libraries needed — pure CSS/flexbox Gantt rendering
- Use only: React hooks, Tailwind CSS (or inline styles), lucide-react icons
- Ensure the module does NOT conflict with existing routes — mount it at `/roadmap` or as a tab in the existing nav"**

This prompt gives Replit Agent everything it needs — the data schema, component architecture, interaction logic, visual specs, and integration boundaries — so it can build it cleanly into your existing app without ambiguity.
